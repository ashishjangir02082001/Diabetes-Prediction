# ML---Diabetes-Prediction-

### **Overview:**

This is an ML based prediction project implemented in Python language that classifies whether a person is diabetic or
not by looking at various health-related parameters. The project has been implemented using the Support Vector Machine 
Classifier with an accuracy of nearly 78%. The accuracy is low because the dataset taken is bit small. However, it can
be increased by taking a larger dataset so that we can train the model on lot more values and can visualize the data more
effectively to predict the results.

### The libraries and editor used to develop this project are:
